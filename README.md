In my analysis I'll focus primarly on women's and men's clothing sales

<h2 id='data-exploration'>1. Data exploration</h2>
Frist of all let's understand the structure of this dataset, by exploring basic information about columns, number of records, date range.

* Columns in dataset

<h2 id='data-analysis'>2. Data analysis</h2>
 
 In this section I will mostly deepdive into analysis of the dataset for men's and women's clothing stores. 
 In the end there is a also a section dedicated to recessions comparison where I stack up performace of different kinds of businesses.

 There are two null values in 2020 for men's sales

  <h3 id='yearly-sales-share'>2.1 Yearly sales share</h3>
  On the chart we can discern a downwards trend for men's clothing sales in comparison to women's sales

The 2020 drop in difference is mainly caused by the fact of 2 null values in men's clothing sales

In general men's share on clothing sales in on downwards trend since mid/late 90's

<h3 id='monthly-sales-share'>2.2 Monthly sales share</h3>
Now I'm going to do the same as above but for every month individually

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae532d31-e9fd-478b-8bee-9593840fb63a)

![pct_monthly_men_women](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/a84aa4f3-0d46-43bd-a759-85be2fa53b0a)


As we can see percentage of men's sales increase seasonally in the christmas period than women's clothing sales

![monthly_sales](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/6e19157c-64ec-4f47-81e2-ae9e7232a7e3)

Cristmas period appears to influence people's buying tendency.
After December, a noticable drop in January/February is clearly visible.
Another noteworthy thing is how much sales plummeted after COVID-19 lockdown (2020).

We can apply rolling average to smooth out visualization
Rolling average for women's sales:

<h3 id='yoy-growth'>2.3 YoY Growth</h3>
For each month I'll compare cumulative sales of last 12 months
First of all, let's get cumulative sales of last 12 months
![image](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/f2e7af7c-60a2-42c0-b37e-1e8078a3369b)

![cumulative_yearly_Sales](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/ab8cc9e3-68ba-4457-86fe-706d129f0e9f)

Apart from covid economic recession, there is also quite distinguishable impact of Great Recession which took place in 2008-2009

Now, let's use lag function to stack it up against last_year result in order to get YoY growth
![image](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/36e3d805-d32a-4210-9b31-c3d1f598cfeb)

![yoy-growth](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/b265188b-d7a0-45a7-a8f0-d1436ecae61e)

It affirms my previous statements about massive drops standing out, in 2009 (-13% growth for men and -9% growth for women's sales) and 2020 ( down to about -30% of yoy growth). Also there is less one another decline only in men's sales category in 2002 reaching -10% yoy growth.

<h3 id='seasonal-fluctuations)'>2.4  Seasonal fluctuations </h3>
Here I'm going to compare sales from two periods of the year:
  - December
  - Rest of the year

This will provide a better insight on increasing buying power during Christmas. I'm going to focus on women's clothing sales
![image](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/73111a7e-2320-4aec-b7d7-119df7cb5964)

![december_to_rest_ratio](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/7298bfad-5bf9-46be-82dd-877214364d1f)

Ratio in the 2010's is about 1.3 to 1.4 (exception is 2020 COVID Christmas) while in the 90's and early-mid 00's it was oscilating about 1.6. People, back in 1990-2006, used to spend more on clothing for christmas than it is in 2010's which could be attributed to the effects of the Great Recession.

 <h3 id='recessions-analysis'>2.5 Recessions analysis</h3>
To undestand the powerful impact of two infamous economic downturns: Great Recession and COVID-19, I'll compare how sales plumetted for different businesses.
In order to provide easily readible comparison I'll use only businesses which don't have any null sales


![image](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/b29ec437-b6c5-48a7-a6ac-9aecb9fb6635)


* **Great Recession**
  
  I performed a query to look for a minimum value in yoy pct growth among these business categories which didn't have any null values
  ![image](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/7ec1b406-bc82-4be3-ac29-56eeb52f43a6)
  ![Great_recession](https://github.com/veektorf1/Monthly_Retail_Trade_USA/assets/125961580/14b973c4-dc89-44b9-ba30-dd988734602e)

  Majority of business categories suffered from a massive decline in yoy growth. But there were also the ones which weren't that strongly affected by 
  Great Recession, e.g. Health and personal care stores (+2.19%), Grocery stores (-0.59%), Food and beverage stores (-0.51%) which includes basic necessities.

  Among the businesses with greatest decline (below -15%) in yoy growth there are mainly furniture stores (-16%), automobile dealers, used car dealers, new car dealers (-16 to -25%)  and fuel dealers with decline reaching almost -30%.

* **COVID-19**

  In case of COVID-19, e-commerce businesses were dealing pretty good with lockdown as people were forced to stay in home and the most convenient way to buy products was online. Therefore Electronic shopping and mail-order houses and Nonstore retailers sales rocketed over that period by at least 13% in comparison to previous year.

The covid recession touched severly businesses that rely on stationary shops like clothing stores, book stores, shoe stores.
